Computer and web developer,
My greatest strength is my ability to work well in a team environment, enthusiasm, curiosity, responsibility, discipline, creativity, and respect.
I love working on a team and see a project that grows from the birth of an idea to create a new product.
I am interested in web programming and application development and want to become an expert in these big areas.
